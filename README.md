# Deskbird tech test

DNF due to time constraints, as I only allocate about 1 to technical tests. What's here already gives a pretty good indication of where I was going and my thought process. I also have other projects on my github page that kind do this thing and are more complex and are currently in use. If there are any doubts please reach out.

I'm also not sure if what there's currently there works because i did not test it (again because of time constraints)

## decisions

Used mongo instead of postgres because it's what I already had setup and ready to go locally and didn't want to waste time unnecessarily and it's the one i've most experience with

Use joi as schema validation because it's the one im most familiar with

## Things i would've also done

- setup docker so it would run anywhere without prior local hassle and configs
- add unit tests
- finish the base requirements
- finish schema specifications (instead of just leaving as todo)
- improve on the whole user / password typing
- setup test, build and local run scripts
- should've also got git running at the start and commited as i went, but timings
